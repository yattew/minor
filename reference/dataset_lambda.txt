A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments.

Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result.

The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument.
